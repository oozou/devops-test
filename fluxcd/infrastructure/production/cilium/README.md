# Note

- Please check the installation guide at https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/installation/k8s-install-helm/, under `EKS` section. There are some pre-installation steps to do before you can use Flux to install this and post-installation steps as well.
- As we use Cilium, we'll lose the ability to specify security group as a source in a security group. EKS module creates this [cluster_security_group_id](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/4.67.0/docs/resources/eks_cluster#cluster_security_group_id) security group which attach to both master and worker nodes and it leverages this kind of setting to allow control-plane-to-data-plane communication. So we need to fix this by getting the `cluster_security_group_id` security group id and add a new rule to accept all connections from intra subnet (EKS master) **via AWS management consolse**. Otherwise EKS workers doesn't accept requests from the master. As of this point of written, there is no way to make change of this security group via Terraform yet.
